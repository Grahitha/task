2.	Very useful when we are away from mobile and there is an urgency to send documents to a contact. 
3.	We can also make calls using whatsapp web when the phone is switched-off.

But as this is impractical so I was given a task to remotely login, logout and block  multiple devices. Once a device is blocked , further logins are not allowed for the device. We provide the device name along with its corresponding action like login, logout and block.  And finally we get the summary of active devices(devices that are logged in) and Blocked devices.
